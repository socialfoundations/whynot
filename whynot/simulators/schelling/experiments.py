    Each unit in the experiment is a grid or "community" in the Schelling model.
    Treatment corresponds to randomly educating some fraction of the
    agents in the grid to decrease their homophiliy. The measure outcome is the
    fraction of segregated agents on the grids. In this experiment, treatment is
    randomly assigned.

    ----------
        education_pc: float
            What percentrage of the population of the treated units should be "educated"
        education_boost: int
            How much receiving "education" changes the homophily of an agent

        num_samples: int
            How many units to sample for the experiment

        parallelize: bool
            (Optional) Whether or not to use parallelism during the experiment
