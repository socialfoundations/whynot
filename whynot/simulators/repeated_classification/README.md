# Repeated Classification
The [repeated classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04383) is simple
model of group retention interacts with repeated retraining of machine learning
classifiers based on the paper:

    Fairness Without Demographics in Repeated Loss Minimization. Tatsunori B
    Hashimoto, Megha Srivastava, Hongseok Namkoong, Percy Liang Proceedings of the
    35th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2018).

The intended purpose of the model was to study how standard empirical risk
minimization can amplify group representation disparities over time.
