    "For a concrete example, suppose a researcher wishes to estimate the causal effect of quitting smoking on general health. Correlation between qutting smoking and general health does not necessarily imply that qutting smoking improves health, because other variables, such as exercising, might affect both one's general health and the decision to quit smoking. It is at best difficult and expensive to conduct controlled experiments on smoking status in the general population. However, the researcher may attempt to estimate the causal effect of quitting smoking on health from observational data by using the tax rate for tobacco products as an instrument for smoking. The tax rate for tobacco products is a reasonable choice for an instrument because the researcher assumes that it can only be correlated with health through its effect on whether an individual quits smoking or not. If the researcher then finds tobacco taxes and state of health to be correlated, this may be viewed as evidence that quitting smoking causes changes in health."
