    "The paper proposes an agent-based model that models incarceration as \"contagious\" in the sense that social ties to incarcerated individuals lead to a higher risk of being imprisoned. The simulation occurs on a fixed set of agents with a fixed set of social ties. What varies is the randomness with which incarceration is passed on and randomness in sentence length. Transition probabilities, and the sentence length distribution are based on real data. The paper shows that higher-on-average sentence lengths for black individuals than for whites lead to a disparity in incarceration rates that resembles the one observed in the United States."

In fact, in reality researchers are often hoping to recover some form of randomization due to the fact that different judges lead to different sentencing distributions, and the assignment to judges is randomized in certain scenarios."
