Simulators
==========
WhyNot provides a large number of simulated environments from fields ranging
from economics to epidemiology. Each simulator comes equipped with a
representative set of causal inference experiments and will export a uniform
Python interface that makes it easy to construct new causal inference
experiments in these environments.

The simulators in WhyNot can be split into two main categories: system
dynamics models which use differential equations to model interactions between
different components of a system over time and agent-based models which
represent a system as a collection of interacting, heterogeneous agents. Below
we describe the set of simulators currently available in WhyNot.

*Disclaimer:* The simulators in our work are not intended to be realistic
models of the world, but rather realistic models of the technical difficulties
that the real world poses for causal inference. In many cases, the simulators
present in WhyNot have been disputed and criticized as models of the real
world.

epidemic developed by `Chen et al.
<https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2723405>`_ (JAMA,
2019). The model is calibrated based on past opioid use data from the Center
for Disease Control and was developed to simulate the effect of interventions
like reducing the number of new non-medical users of opioids on future opioid
overdose deaths in the United States. The simulator is a time-varying
differential equations model in 3 variables. For a complete description,

.. _civil-violence-simulator:

Civil Violence Simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Civil Violence is an agent-based model of civil violence `introduced by Joshua
Epstein in 2002 <http://www.pnas.org/content/99/suppl_3/7243>`_. The model was
originally used to study the complex dynamics of decentralized rebellion and
revolution and to examine the state's efforts to counter these dynamics. The
model consists of two types of actors: agents and cops. Agents are
heterogenous, and their varied features make them more or less likely to
actively rebel against the state. The rich dynamics of the model emerge from
the interaction between agents and between agents and cops: agents are more
likely to begin rebel if other agents start to rebel, and the cops attempt to
arrest rebelling agents.

**Agents**
The agent-based simulator contains both agents and cops. Cops are homogenous,
while agents are individually endowed with the following (parameterized) qualities:

* Experienced hardship
* Belief in regime legitimacy
* Vision- number of adjacent squares an agent can inspect
* Rebellion threshold
* Risk aversion

**Simulation Parameters**

* Grid size (height and width)
* Density of cops
* Density of agents
* Cop vision- how many adjacent squares cops can inspect
* Maximum jail term length
* Prison interaction term
* Arrest probability constant (for calibration)

The implementation of this simulator is taken from the `examples <https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/tree/master/examples>`_ of the `mesa library <https://github.com/projectmesa>`_.

.. _incarceration-simulator:

Incarceration Simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The incarceration simulator is based on the paper:

    Lum K, Swarup S, Eubank S, Hawdon J. *The contagious nature of
    imprisonment: an agent-based model to explain racial disparities in
    incarceration rates*.
    J R Soc Interface. 2014;11(98):20140409. `doi:10.1098/rsif.2014.0409
    <https://dx.doi.org/10.1098%2Frsif.2014.0409>`_

The paper proposes an agent-based model that models incarceration as
"contagious" in the sense that social ties to incarcerated individuals lead to
a higher risk of being imprisoned. The simulation occurs on a fixed set of
agents with a fixed set of social ties. What varies is the randomness with
which incarceration is passed on and randomness in sentence length. Transition
probabilities, and the sentence length distribution are based on real data.
The paper shows that higher-on-average sentence lengths for black individuals
than for whites lead to a disparity in incarceration rates that resembles the
one observed in the United States.


.. _lotka-volterra-simulator:

Lotka-Volterra Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Lotka-Volterra is a classical differential equation model of the interactions
between predator and prey in a single ecosystem. It serves as a simple example
to showcase how to use WhyNot to construct causal inference problems from
dynamical systems.  The model was originally developed to understand and
explain perplexing fishery statistics during World War I- namely why the
hiatus of fishing during the war led to an observed increase in the number of
predators.

For more details, see `Scholl 2012
<https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f314/7c9d2e43aafc492852f552990a3b21315ca5.pdf?_ga=2.132703694.1945084113.1556061073-1443175395.1541897531>`_.

The simulator is system of ordinary differential equations in two variables.

**State Variables**

* Number of foxes
* Number of rabbits

**Simulation Parameters**

* Policy year (year of intervention)
* Rabbit growth factor
* Rabbit death factor

.. _lending-simulator:

Lending Simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Lending simulator is based on the paper:

    Liu, L., Dean, S., Rolf, E., Simchowitz, M., & Hardt, M. (2018, July).
    Delayed Impact of Fair Machine Learning. In International Conference on
    Machine Learning (pp. 3156-3164). Chicago.

The paper proposes a simple lending model in which individuals apply for
loans, a lending institution approves or denies the loan on the basis of the
individual's credit score, and subsequent loan repayment or default in turn
changes the individual's credit score. Credit scores and repayment probabilities
are based on real FICO data. In this dynamic setting, the paper shows that
static fairness criterion do not in genearl promote improvement over time and
can indeed cause active harm.

.. _repeated-classification:

Repeated Classification Simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Repeated Classification simulator is based on the paper:

    Hashimoto, T., Srivastava, M., Namkoong, H., & Liang, P. (2018, July). Fairness
    Without Demographics in Repeated Loss Minimization. In International Conference
    on Machine Learning (pp. 1929-1938).

The paper proposes a simplified model of interaction between individuals from
different subgroups and standard machine learning classifiers based on empirical
risk minimization. In the model, decreases in accuracy on different subgroups
cause individuals to exit the system, further decreasing accuracy in these
subgroups and creating a negative feedback loop. The paper shows that, when
combined with repeated empirical risk minimization, even initially fair models
can become unfair over time if this dynamic is not accounted for.


.. _schelling-simulator:

Schelling Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `Schelling model
<https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/Schelling_Seg_Models.pdf>`_
is a classic agent-based model originally used to illustrate how weak
individual preferences regarding one's neighbhors can lead to global
segregation of entire cities. In the model, individuals prefer to live where
at least some fraction of their neighbors are the same race as they are and
will move if this constraint is not met. As this process is iterated, an
originally well-mixed city rapidly becomes segregated by group.

**Agents**
The agents in Schelling's model are labeled either Type 0 or Type 1,
corresponding to members of the majority or minority class.

**Simulation Parameters**

* Grid size (height, width)
* Agent density
* Percentage of minority agents
* Homophily
* Education boost (how much receiving ``education`` decreases homophily)
* Percentage of agents receiving education

The implementation of this simulator is taken from the `examples <https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/tree/master/examples>`_ of the `mesa library <https://github.com/projectmesa>`_.

.. _lalonde-simulator:

LaLonde Synthetic Outcome Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Lalone simulator is based on data from `Robert LaLonde's 1986 study
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/1806062>`_ evaluating the impact of the National
Supported Work Demonstration, a labor training program, on post-intervention
income levels. Since the actual function mapping the measured covariates to
the observed outcomes is unknown, we instead simulate random functions of
varying complexity on the data to generate synthetic outputs. This procedure
allows us to generate causal inference problems with response surfaces of
varying, but known complexity.

In the Lalonde data, the function mapping covariates :math:`X` to outcome
:math:`Y` is unknown, and it is impossible to simulate ground truth. Therefore,
following `Hill et al. <https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02641>`_, we replace the
true outcome :math:`Y` with one generated by functions :math:`f_0, f_1`,
corresponds to control and treatment, as follows. Let :math:`W` denote
treatment assignment.
Then,

.. math::
    f_0(X) = Y(0),
    f_1(X) = Y(1),
    Y = Y(W).
